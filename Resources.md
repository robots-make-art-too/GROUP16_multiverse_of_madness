Aesthetic Resources:
1. Skymap is an AR program which displays the locations of stars in the  sky as well as offering the user ways to interact with it. We could use similar sky manipulation and look at how they built the interface. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&hl=
2. While we won't actively be using photoshop in our project, this kind of photo manipulation may help us write our code. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrkFfl8M6Q&ab_channel=PhotoshopTutorialsbyLayerLife
3. If we wanted to have objects with 3d elements on what would seem like a 2d plane (like the sky) this would be a neat idea. https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/augmented-images
4. The user interface is always an important part of any technology so this will help us pay special attention to that. https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/emerging-technology/ux-design-principles-for-augmented-reality/
5. Similar to SkyMap this is another program which distinguishes the sky and displays important data on the screen. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ajnaware.sunseeker&hl=en_CA&gl=US

Technical Resources: 
1. While we would likely avoid frameworks like this as instead we would focus on our own coding, Wikitude may give us a good jumping off point for starting with AR. https://www.wikitude.com/products/wikitude-sdk/
2. It seems another good way of implement AR technology is image targets. Although this does not fit with the sky manipulation idea, we could use these as objects to place on the screen/sky. https://library.vuforia.com/features/images/image-targets.html
3. Plane Detection will be very important if we choose to make a program manipulating the appearance of the sky. By targetting places of high contrast, feature points are created to calculate surfaces. https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/spatial-mapping/plane-detection/
4. While this technology may not be available on all devices, depth sensoring would help greatly with seperating planes automatically. https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/depth
5. Debugging will undoubtedly be critical in developping our program so these resources will ensure we can find issues in our work. https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/debugging
