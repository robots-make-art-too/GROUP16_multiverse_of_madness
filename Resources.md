# Technical Resources
    1. I can come up with many ways to achive a 3-D space in max with moving objects as if they have life in themas for whether i can use that in other softwares i am not sure yet.

    2.I am not very skilled in processing but i can work out any kind of not too hard tasks given too me with the right amount of time.

    3.I think using unity would be a great choice even though we have no experience in it because it is a famous worldwide used software from which great realistic game's were born.

    4.3-D object can be made easily by using apps such as Sketchup and 3D painter that is given free with windows.

    5.We can try to come up with techniques the Ai can pick up as signs of gestures such as hand waving or our eyes blinking or our mouth smiling.


# Aesthetic Resources
    1.Filters from many different apps specialy the 3d filters in samsung camera's was a huge influence to me in choosing this kind of project.
    
    2.Space films such as Alien and Sputnik really help my imagination in how we can design a 3d sky/space VR.

    3.Videos from The Coding Train Youtube channel help me come up with ways of coding i didn't know before since i have little to no experience with coding, thanks to their videos i can come up with ways to to make the project look more immersive.
    
    4.Unity has thier own community where people help each other out from around the world with ther problems which we could use as a way to benefit our skills and understanding of unity.
    
    5.I've created few 3d Max spaces before and i was very inspired in making more 3-D, VR related work and hope to get more skilled in this category while doing this project.
