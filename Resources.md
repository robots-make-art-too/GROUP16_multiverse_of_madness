2.  **Cosmic Artworks from films such as Interstellar and Dr. Strange** really help my imagination. I was watching a documentary about how a few seconds of black hole animation took the creators months to program and make it mathematically perfect. It was so accurate that the creator wrote an actual paper about black holes.

3. Videos from **The Coding Train Youtube channel** help in artistic way as well. Since I am not from a coding background, I watch those videos to understand what things can be achieved via pure coding. This is how I got the idea of moving across **3D noise for star-like effect**.

4. Audio plays an equally important part in immersive artworks and often gets neglected. I think for cosmic artwork, no music can compete to **Hans Zimmer's melodies** in Christopher Nolan's movies.

5. Recently, **AI art** is a hot topic in the art community. It keeps changing every moment and makes us question reality which makes sense for this project.

4. The user interface is always an important part of any technology so this will help us pay special attention to that. https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/emerging-technology/ux-design-principles-for-augmented-reality/
5. Similar to SkyMap this is another program which distinguishes the sky and displays important data on the screen. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ajnaware.sunseeker&hl=en_CA&gl=US

Technical Resources: 
1. While we would likely avoid frameworks like this as instead we would focus on our own coding, Wikitude may give us a good jumping off point for starting with AR. https://www.wikitude.com/products/wikitude-sdk/
2. It seems another good way of implement AR technology is image targets. Although this does not fit with the sky manipulation idea, we could use these as objects to place on the screen/sky. https://library.vuforia.com/features/images/image-targets.html
3. Plane Detection will be very important if we choose to make a program manipulating the appearance of the sky. By targetting places of high contrast, feature points are created to calculate surfaces. https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/spatial-mapping/plane-detection/
4. While this technology may not be available on all devices, depth sensoring would help greatly with seperating planes automatically. https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/depth
5. Debugging will undoubtedly be critical in developping our program so these resources will ensure we can find issues in our work. https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/debugging
