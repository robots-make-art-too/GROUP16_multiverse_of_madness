# Base Concept Summary
- We plan to build an immersive AR experience that changes the elements of reality. 
- Basically, we intend to use some sort of luma/colour keying algorithm to break apart foreground and replacing the sky background with cosmic art pieces. 
- The background is sensitive to gyroscopic data from mobile device's sensors and moves along with it. 
- The base layer of the background would be a 3D skybox with additional layers of 3D objects and noise animations. 
- Since our theme is based on cosmic art, we have a wide window of opportunities as there are practically no limits to things we can add. 
- Our main artistic goal for the artwork is to break the laws of reality and have complete flexibility in realm bending effects.
- We look forward to incorporating a node-based programming style that gives us the flexibility of adding layers of effects that run in alignment with each other.

# Key Discussion Log
(written in third person)

- Xin - Initial Idea of AR Room Decoration system or something that incorporated 3D models and AR.
- Jasmin - Agreed with AR. Suggested making an AR-based sky replacement filter on Instagram due to prior experience with sky replacement effect and Instagram filters. Sky would be replaced with a cosmic background. 
- Xin- Agreed to provide 3D models due to prior experience in 3D modelling.
- Jasmin - 3D models can be added as a layer to cosmic space. We can also incorporate Max for 3D animation as it is the closest software we know that mixes coding and art.
- We exchanged some artistic references. (https://www.instagram.com/coolacloy/)
- Others agreed to incorporate other software due to our prior experience with Max and less experience in coding. We will add more functionality as we learn more coding.
- Jasmin - New layer of 3D noise can be added to achieve a star-like effect that is sensitive to gyroscopic data and device movements. It gives a sense of moving across stars.
- Xin - Stars can be made interactive to hand movements...fly around or crash into one another.
- Xin - (Raised question) How would the artwork interact? Touch? Cursor (if on pc)? or Hand?
 -Jasmin - Ideally, the movements of the skybox should be automated according to the sensor data. However, hand movement detection can be added if coding knowledge isn't a constraint in future.
- Jasmin - Since we need an AR engine that uses a camera and phone sensors, Spark AR can be of great help. It has a node-based programming style with Javascript integration. It also solves the issue of the platform as the end product would be an Instagram filter.
- Would it be okay to use another software, though? Email interaction with professor...
 -Xin- Skeptical about the base idea. Proposes a second idea - We scan a picture and present a 3D model of it. Suggested using Unity Engine.
- Everyone voted. Sticked to the initial idea of cosmic artwork. 
- Mishal - Agreed on the use of Unity.
 -Xin - Worried about how sky replacement would work. The logic behind the working of it? Any working example?
- Jasmin - Explained the concept of luma/colour keying where similar pixels get masked out of the image, breaking it into foreground/background. Have achieved the effect in Max Jitter for a DATT project and softwares like After Effects and Premiere Pro. 
- As the professor suggested during email interaction, everyone agreed on no need to necessarily worry about the implementation yet and work on ideas and scope for the current Phase.
