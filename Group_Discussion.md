# Base_Concept_Summary
- We plan to build an immersive AR experience that changes the elements of reality. 
- Basically we intend to use some sort of luma/color keying algorithm to break apart foreground and background by replacing the sky and replacing that background with cosmic art pieces. 
- The background is sensitive to gyroscopic data from mobile device's sensors and moves along with it. 
- The base layer of background would be a 3D sky box with additional layers of 3D objects and noise animations. 
- Since our theme is based on cosmic art, we have a wide window of opportunities as there is practically no limits to things we can add. 
- Our main artistic goal for the artwork is to break the laws of reality and have full flexibility of changing realm
- We look forward to incorporate node-based programming style which gives us flexbility of adding layers of effects that run in alignment with each other.

# Key_Discussion_Log
(written in third person)

- Xin - Initial Idea of AR Room Decoration system or something that incorporated 3D models and AR.
- Jasmin - Agreed with AR. Suggested making an AR based sky replacement filter on Instagram due to prior experience with sky replacement effect and Instagram filters. Sky would be replaced with cosmic background. 
- Xin- Agreed to provide 3D models due to prior experience in 3D modelling.
- Jasmin - 3D models can be added as a layer to cosmic space. Can also incorporate Max for 3D animation as it is closest software we know that mixes coding and art.
- We exchanged some artistic references. (https://www.instagram.com/coolacloy/)
- Others agreed with incorporation of other softwares due to our prior experience with Max and less experience in coding. Will add more functionality as we learn more coding.
- Jasmin - New layer of 3D noise can be added to achieve a star-like effect which is sensitive to gyroscopic data and device movements. Gives a sense of moving across stars.
- Xin - Stars can be made interactive to hand movements...fly around or crash into one another.
- Xin - Raised question. How would the artwork interact? Touch? Cursor (if on pc)? or Hand?
 -Jasmin - Ideally the movements of skybox should be automated according to the sensor data. However, hand movement detection can be added if coding knowledge isn't a constraint in future.
- Jasmin - Since we need an AR engine that uses camera as well as phone sensors, Spark AR can be of great help. Has a node-based programming style with Javascript integration. Solves the issue of platform as end product would be an instagram filter.
- Would it be okay to use another software though? Email interaction with professor...
 -Xin- Skeptical about base idea. Proposes second idea - We scan a picture and present a 3D model for it. Can also use Unity.
- Everyone voted. Sticked to the initial idea of cosmic artwork. Agreed on use of Unity.
 -Xin - Worried about how would sky replacement work. Logic behind the working of it? Any working example?
- Jasmin - Explained the concept of luma/color keying where similar pixels get masked out of image breaking it into foreground/background. Have achieved the effect in Max Jitter for a DATT project and softwares like After Effects and Premier Pro. 
- As professor suggested in mail, everyone agreed on no need to necessarily worry about the implementation yet and work on ideas and scope for the current Phase.
